# Leftovers

Small, real, and deferred on purpose. Nothing here is blocking a ship; everything
here is the kind of item that quietly never gets done because it never becomes
urgent — until it does, at which point it is expensive.

The rule for this file: an item earns a line only if it is **concrete** (someone
could do it today without a design), and it carries **why it was deferred** and
**what makes it expensive later**. If an item needs a design, it belongs in a real
roadmap, not here.

## Open

<!-- DONE 07-22: "Walk the new automation primitives in the real app" — walked
against the PACKAGED app (stronger than the dev-shell ask). Agent side driven
via /api/run: wait (match + real 10s timeout), click text (matched_by:text +
navigation), extract selector+attr (30 matches), flow failing at the reported
step WITH screenshot on disk (twice), check_save→run→`## Runs` line, plus
open_tab (session:ephemeral honored), find_elements, read, screenshot (valid
PNG). Operator confirmed GUI side: co-presence badge flashed on every call,
7-tab eviction, sidebar bumper/⌘B, zoom, ⌘F count, popup-as-tab, download +
reveal, menu accelerators, and the double-launch single-instance check. -->

### Refresh out-of-repo prompts naming the old click/fill error atoms

**What.** `browser_click` / `browser_fill` fallbacks were renamed
`:missing_index` / `:missing_index_or_value` → `:missing_target` /
`:missing_target_or_value` on 07-18 (they can fail on more than an index now).
The repo is clean; anything *outside* it — saved prompts, agent skill docs,
personal notes — that names the old atoms should be updated.

**Why deferred.** Nothing in the repo can find or fix out-of-repo text.

**What makes it expensive later.** It doesn't get more expensive; it just
quietly misleads whoever reads that prompt next.

### Confirm the rotated DB password reached the password manager

**What.** The 07-18 Supabase rotation printed the new BusterClaw DB password
exactly once, in-session; it exists nowhere else. Confirm it's stored, then
delete this item. (The personal access token pasted that day needed no
revocation — 1-hour TTL, long expired.)

**Why deferred.** Only the operator can check their password manager.

**What makes it expensive later.** Nothing — nothing authenticates with the
DB password and a reset stays a two-minute dashboard job. Pure bookkeeping.

## Rules of engagement

- An item leaves this file by being **done** or by being **promoted** to a real
  roadmap because it turned out to need a design. It does not leave by rotting.
- If an item has sat here through two dev summaries without moving, that is a
  signal it is either not actually worth doing (delete it, and say so) or it is
  more important than "leftover" implies (promote it).
